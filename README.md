The Algae Growth and Environmental Conditions Dataset , which we prepared, is used for microbial protein quality classification tasks. This dataset comprises real-time measurements of 100 algae samples, each undergoing 10 tests at 10-minute intervals within an experimental window of approximately 1.5 hours per sample to determine microbial protein quality. The data is divided into 80% for training and 20% for testing. It includes important environmental and biochemical parameters that influence algae growth and protein yield.
