We conducted multiple experiments utilizing real-time data to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed deep learning model for classifying protein quality. The Algae Growth and Environmental Conditions Dataset [19], which we prepared, is used for microbial protein quality classification tasks. This dataset comprises real-time measurements of 100 algae samples, each undergoing 10 tests at 10-minute intervals within an experimental window of approximately 1.5 hours per sample to determine microbial protein quality. The data is divided into 80% for training and 20% for testing. It includes important environmental and biochemical parameters that influence algae growth and protein yield.
Key features within the dataset include ‘Algae_ID’, a unique identifier for each sample; ‘Test_Number’, representing the sequential test order; ‘Timestamp’, indicating the date and time of each algae test at 10-minute intervals; ‘Temperature’, which describes the environmental temperature (Good: 25–35°C, Average: 36–40°C, Poor: <25°C or >40°C); ‘pH level’, which reflects the acidity of the growth medium (Good: 6.5–7.5, Average: 5.5–6.4 or 7.6–8.5, Poor: <5.5 or >8.5); ‘Oxygen Concentration’, the percentage of oxygen available for algae respiration (Good: 80–90%, Average: 70–79%, Poor: <70% or >90%); ‘Microbial Density (OD600)’, indicating algae biomass (Good: 0.8–1.2, Average: 0.6–0.79 or 1.21–1.5, Poor: <0.6 or >1.5); ‘Turbidity’, the medium turbidity due to microbial growth, measured in NTU (Good: 40–60, Average: 30–39 or 61–75, Poor: <30 or >75); and ‘Protein Yield’, the amount of protein produced (Good: >500 mg/L, Average: 350–500 mg/L, Poor: <350 mg/L).
